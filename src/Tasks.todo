TODO:
    ☐ Console log all react hooks, effects.

    

Scenarios to test:
    ☐ Test coming in, metamask should not popup, right now it is because of totalSupply call
    ☐ Coming in, on click should connect 
    ☐ On mint, show connect metamask button
    ☐ On mint, show wrong network if it is wrong
    ☐ Update my network and smart contract, on Network changed

    ☐ Use infura to display supply and price far? Should not be hard.
